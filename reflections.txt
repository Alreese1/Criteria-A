Gaming can actually be healthy for you more than what people think, many people at times think at times they are just always bad for you and cause problems a long the way for others and will just make them more dumb,and messes up your life but really it can help with all of that.

Though I do agree with both sides of arguments saying that games are bad or good but it all depends on how you use them, think of them and how long you play and knowing when to stop.

I do agree that for some people that play games too much and let it get to there head and they allow it to contorl over there lives can be bad

Also no I don't let games get control of me really and know when to stop.

Though here are some reasons why games can be healthy for you, one some games can help with reaction, memory, can actually help with joint issues in the fingers and can help you be more creative and much more.
